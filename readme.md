# Expo Supabase Gluestack Starter

## Overview

* Expo Router
* Supabase auth with their database and file storage ready to go
* Gluestack component library (based on Nativewind)
* React Hook Form and Zod
* ESLint and Prettier
* Jest

This starter is a bringing together of 3 other starters:

1. The Expo Tabs template was the starting point
2. Parts of the Gluestack starter kit was used for the UI, particularly auth
3. Parts of the Expo Supabase Starter was used to inform the supabase integration

A complete authentication flow was written, including protecting routes and forgotten password.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. If you don't have a Supabase project, you can create one for free
4. Then add your EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY to a .env file
5. Update the dependencies with `npx expo install --fix`
